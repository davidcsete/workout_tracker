# CORS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
The original CORS configuration was causing this error:
```
Rack::Cors::Resource#initialize': Allowing credentials for wildcard origins is insecure. 
Please specify more restrictive origins or set 'credentials' to false in your CORS configuration.
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed CORS from application.rb
- Removed the insecure CORS configuration from `config/application.rb`

### 2. Created Dedicated CORS Initializer
- Created `config/initializers/cors.rb` with environment-specific configurations:
  - **Development**: Allows localhost origins with credentials + wildcard without credentials
  - **Production**: Uses `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable for specific domains

### 3. Updated Deployment Configuration
- Added `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to `config/deploy.yml` for production deployment
- Updated deployment guide with proper CORS security instructions

## Current Configuration

### Development
- Allows `localhost:3000`, `127.0.0.1:3000`, etc. with credentials
- Also allows wildcard origins without credentials for flexibility

### Production
- Uses `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Supports multiple domains (comma-separated)
- Enables credentials for trusted origins only

## Usage

Set the environment variable in production:
```bash
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-domain.com,https://your-mobile-app.com"
```

This configuration is now secure and ready for Hotwire Native deployment!
